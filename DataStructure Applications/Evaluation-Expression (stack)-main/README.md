# Evaluation-Expression
application on stack

JAVA program that takes a symbolic infix expression as input
and converts it to postfix notation, enter the values of each symbol, evaluates the postfix
expression and outputs the resulting expression and its value. All operands are integer values,
but intermediate results could be floating points. Your program should support the operators
+, -, * and /. Expressions can contain parentheses. You should use the stack implementation
you did in part (A) for any stack data structure needed in the program
